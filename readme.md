For more information on what `generator-yawa` can do for you, take a look at the [Grunt tasks](https://github.com/p-j/generator-yawa/blob/master/app/templates/_package.json) used in our `package.json`.

## Getting Started

- Install: `npm install -g generator-yawa`
- Run: `yo yawa`
- Run `grunt build` for building and `grunt server` for preview

## Options

* `--skip-install`

  Skips the automatic execution of `bower` and `npm` after scaffolding has finished.

* `--test-framework <framework>`

  Defaults to `mocha`. Can be switched for another supported testing framework like `jasmine`.

## TODO
* Investigate other template engine integration (Dust.js, Underscore, Jade...) using Assemble (or not).
